# Recipe Index

A collection of recipes I have cooked. Or, noteworthy ones, at least. I usually start at one (or more) sources and modify the recipe to what I have, want to eat, or want to taste.

Ratings are on a 1-10 scale. 1 indicates it's terrible, 5 is decent to eat, nothing special, and 10 is S-tier. There'll a bias towards higher scores just because I might not bother writing down mediocre recipes.

You can see this site on [connor4312.github.io/recipes](https://connor4312.github.io/recipes/), or by cloning this repo and running `go run ./`.
