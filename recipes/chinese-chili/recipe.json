    "Did not have Szechuan pepper at the time. Used 0.5 tbsp coriander seed and 1 tbsp pepper instead, turned out well",
    "Added 1c dried (rehydrated) pinto beans",
    "Threw ingredients in instant pot on high for 10 minutes after browning meat",
    "Very spicy with the 2x jalapeno and habanero. Perhaps use a Thai pepper or Serano instead next time. If making for company, just 2x jalapenos would be fine"

Add tomatoes. Return meat and juices to the pan. Cover and simmer an hour and a half, until the meat is tender.",
    "Stir in vinegar. Mixture should be somewhat soupy; add some water if needed. Drizzle in chile oil to taste. Adjust salt with soy sauce. Garnish with cilantro and serve."
